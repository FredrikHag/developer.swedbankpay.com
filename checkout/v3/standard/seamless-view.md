  The Seamless View purchase scenario shows you how to implement the payment
  menu directly in your webshop.

## Step 1: Create Payment Order And Checkin

When the purchase is initiated, you need to create a payment order.

Start by performing a `POST` request towards the `paymentorder` resource
with payer information and a `completeUrl`.

Two new fields have been added to the payment order request in this integration.
`requireConsumerInfo` and `digitalProducts`. They are a part of the `payer`
node. Please note that `shippingAdress` is only required if `digitalProducts` is
set to `false`. `requireConsumerInfo` **must** be set to `false`.

In some instances you need the possibility to abort purchases. This could be if
a payer does not complete the purchase within a reasonable timeframe. For those
instances we have `abort`, which you can read about in the [core
features][abort-feature]. You can only use `abort` if the payer **has not**
completed an `authorize` or a `sale`.

## Step 2: Display Payment Menu And Checkin

Among the operations in the POST `paymentOrders` response, you will find the
`view-checkout`. This is what you need to display the checkin and payment
module.

{:.code-view-header}
**Response**

```json
{
    "paymentOrder": {
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "href": "https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/payment/core/js/px.payment.client.js?token=dd728a47e3ec7be442c98eafcfd9b0207377ce04c793407eb36d07faa69a32df&culture=sv-SE",
            "rel": "view-checkout",
            "contentType": "application/javascript"
        },
    ]
}
```

Embed the `href` in a `<script>` element. That script will then load the
Seamless View.

To load the Checkout from the JavaScript URL obtained in the backend API
response, it needs to be set as a script elementâ€™s `src` attribute. You can
cause a page reload and do this with static HTML, or you can avoid the page
refresh by invoking the POST to create the payment order through Ajax and then
create the script element with JavaScript. The HTML code will be unchanged in
this example.

{:.code-view-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    response = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    var operation = response.operations.find(function (o) {
        return o.rel === 'view-checkout';
    });
    script.setAttribute('src', operation.href);
    script.onload = function () {
        // When the 'view-checkout' script is loaded, we can initialize the
        // Checkin inside 'checkin-container'.

        // to open the Checkin
        window.payex.hostedView.checkout({
            container: {
                checkinContainer: "checkin-container",
                paymentMenuContainer: "payment-menu-container",
            },
            culture: 'nb-No',
            onShippingDetailsAvailable: function onShippingDetailsAvailable(shippingDetailsAvailableEvent) {
                console.log(shippingDetailsAvailableEvent);
            },
        }).open("checkin");
    };
    // Append the Checkout script to the <head>
    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
    head.appendChild(script);
});
// Like before, you should replace the address here with
// your own endpoint.
request.open('GET', '<Your-Backend-Endpoint-Here>', true);
request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json; charset=utf-8');
request.send();
```

After you have received the shipping details, you can update the payment order
with shipping costs, then proceed to initialize the payment menu.

{:.code-view-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
//to open the Payment Menu
window.payex.hostedView.checkout({
    container: {
        checkinContainer: "checkin-container",
        paymentMenuContainer: "payment-menu-container",
    },
    culture: 'nb-No',
}).open("paymentmenu");
```

{:.code-view-header}
**HTML**

```html
 < !DOCTYPE html >
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Swedbank Pay Checkout is Awesome!</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="checkin-container"></div>
            <div id="payment-menu-container"></div>
            <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
            <script src="<Your-JavaScript-File-Here>"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
```

The result should look like this. First you will see a Checkin module where the
payer can enter their email and phone number.

After checking in, the contact details and shipping address are displayed, along
with the available shipping option(s). When the payer chooses a shipping option,
the payment menu will appear. The payer can then proceed with the purchase.

Once a purchase is complete, you can perform a GET towards the `paymentOrders`
resource to see the purchase state.

You can read about the different [Seamless View Events][seamless-view-events] in
the feature section.

If you want to see the payer activities, they are visible in the history node:

```json
{
 "name": "CheckinInitiated",
 "initiatedBy": "System"
}
{
 "name": "PayerCheckedIn",
 "initiatedBy": "Consumer"
}
{
 "name": "PayerDetailsRetrieved",
 "initiatedBy": "System"
}
{
 "name": "MerchantAuthenticatedConsumerCheckedIn",
 "initiatedBy": "System"
}
```

You are now ready to capture the funds. Follow the link below to read more about
capture and the other options you have after the purchase.
