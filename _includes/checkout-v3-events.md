## {{ product }} Events

During operation in the {{ product }}, several events can occur. They are
described below.

{% include alert.html type="warning" icon="info" header="Event Overrides"
body="Adding an event handler to one of the following events **overrides** the
default event handler, meaning your custom event handler will have to do what
the default event handler did. If you donâ€™t, the behavior of the event is going
to be undefined. Just adding an event handler for logging purposes is therefore
not possible, the event handler will have to perform some functionality similar
to the event handler you are overriding." %}

### `onOutOfViewOpen`

This event triggers when another tab is opened in the browser, like the
information page for onboarding of stored cards, or Swedbank Pay's owner TOS. It

within the same browser.

actions according to it.

{% if documentation_section contains "checkout-v3/starter" %}

### `onPayerIdentified`

This event triggers when a payer has been identified. This event is required for
**Starter** to work, and there are two scenarios where it will occur.

*   The **first** is when the payer has finalized checkin, where this is the
expected merchant behavior:

*   Merchant calls GET on the `paymentOrder` to receive payer data (shipping
    address).

*   Merchant activates shipping cost calculation.

*   When shipping cost is calculated, updat the payment order with new price and
  open Payment Menu.

*   The **second** is when the payer has added or edited a shipping address. In
  those cases, this is the expected merchant behavior:

*   Merchant needs to decide if payment menu should be closed (the menu is
  already open).

*   Merchant calls GET on `payment0rder` again to receive new payer data
    (shipping address).

*   Merchant activates shipping cost calculation if required.

*   If a new shipping cost is calculated, update payment order with the new
    price and open Payment Menu.

It will be raised with the
following event argument object:

{:.code-view-header}
**onPayerIdentified event object**

```json
{
    "event": "OnPayerIdentified",
    "paymentOrder": { "id": "/psp/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_id }}" },
    "payer": "/psp/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_id }}/payers",
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| Field       | Type     | Description                                                            |
| :---------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------         |
| `event`     | `string` | The name of the event raised.                                          |
| `paymentOrder`        | `string` | {% include field-description-id.md %}                        |
| `payer`     | `string` | The `url` of the resource containing information about the payer.      |

### `onPayerUnidentified`

This event triggers when a payer clicks "Not you" when identified with Remember
Me, and it is required for **Starter** to work.

Expected merchant behavior when it occurs is:

*   Merchant needs to close/hide/disable the payment menu iframe.

*   Merchant needs to close shipping calculation until a new `onPayerIdentified`
  is received, as the payer's shipping address could be updated after next
  checkin.

It will be raised with the following event argument object:

{:.code-view-header}
**onPayerUnidentified event object**

```json
{
    "event": "OnPayerUnidentified",
    "paymentOrder": { "id": "/psp/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_id }}" },
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| Field           | Type     | Description                                                  |

| `event`         | `string` | The name of the event raised.                                |
| `paymentOrder`  | `string` | {% include field-description-id.md %}                          |

{% endif %}

### `OnTermsOfServiceRequested`

This event triggers when the user clicks on the "Display terms and conditions"
link.

Subscribe to this event if you don't want the default handing of the
`termsOfServiceUrl`. Swedbank Pay will by default open the `termsOfServiceUrl`
in a new tab within the same browser.

If no callback method is set, terms and conditions will be displayed in an
overlay or a new tab. It will be raised with the following event argument
object:

{:.code-view-header}
**onTermsOfServiceRequested event object**

```json
{
    "origin": "owner",
    "termsOfServiceUrl": "https://example.com/terms-of-service"
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| Field     | Type     | Description                                                                             |

| `termsOfServiceUrl` | `string` | The URL containing Terms of Service and conditions.                                     |
