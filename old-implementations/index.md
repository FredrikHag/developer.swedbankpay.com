If you are a **new merchant** getting started with your implementation, you need
to use [Checkout v3][payments-only]. These implementations are reaching their
sunsets on December 31st 2024 and are only present due to documentation needs of
existing merchants already using them.

If you are an existing merchant already using the Checkout v2, Payment Menu or
our Payment Instruments, we advise you to switch to Checkout v3 for an even
better payment experience.

We do, however, understand that you still need access to the documentation for
these implementations.
