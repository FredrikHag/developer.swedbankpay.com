If you are a **new merchant** getting started with your implementation, you need
to use [Checkout v3][payments-only]. The implementations in this section are
reaching their sunsets on **December 31st 2024**, and are only present due to
documentation needs of existing merchants already using them.

If you are an existing merchant already using the Checkout v2, Payment Menu or
our Payment Instruments, we advise you to switch to [Checkout v3][payments-only]
for an even better payment experience. A migration guide is coming shortly.

We do, however, understand that you still need access to the documentation for
these implementations. Nothing has been deleted, we just moved it a bit. Follow
the links below or in the sidebar to find your section.
